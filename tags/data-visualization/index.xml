      <description>As we all know, insects are a major factor in the world&#39;s agricultural economy. Therefore, it is particularly important to prevent and control agricultural insects by using procedures such as dynamic surveys and real-time monitoring systems for insect population management. However, there are many insects in the farmland, and it takes a lot of time to be manually classified by insect experts. Since people without the knowledge of entomology cannot distinguish the types of insects, it is necessary to develop more rapid and effective methods to solve this problem.</description>

      <description>I believe that for graduate students, what to do after graduation may not have been decided yet. Is it a good choice to continue to study for a PhD, or is it a wise choice to find a job in the industry? What will doctoral degrees bring to students? Which field of doctoral degrees are more popular?
To answer these questions, I found some historical data about doctorates awarded in the United States to display some information behind the data.</description>

      <description>Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. Because malaria causes so much illness and death, the disease is a great drain on many national economies. Since many countries with malaria are already among the poorer nations, the disease maintains a vicious cycle of disease and poverty.</description>
