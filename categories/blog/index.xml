      <description>In this article, I would share my solutions to 3 problems of Project Euler using Python. The problems on Project Euler are designed according to the &amp;quot;one-minute rule&amp;quot;, which shows that an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained in less then one minute. This is a good website where you can practice designing efficient algorithms for many difficult problems. I will continue to resolve problems on this website and update this blog in the future.</description>

      <description>In this article, I would share my experiences and the steps I took when building a personal website on GitHub Pages using Hugo. To build a personal website, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have knowledge other than writing Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, let&amp;rsquo;s go!
You can find my Github repository for this blog here.
Step 1: Install Git Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</description>

      <description>Nice to meet you, and welcome to Linlin Li&amp;rsquo;s website! I am Linlin Li, a student in the Masterâ€™s of Statistical Science program at Duke University.
I have always been eager to create a personal website to write interesting things and record my own growth. Fortunately, one of my courses requires me to update on my website, and I took this opportunity to make this idea come true. In the beginning, I planned to focus on documenting data science projects for future reference and let the website record the track of my learning.</description>
