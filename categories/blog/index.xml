      <description>Star Wars API (SWAPI) is the world&#39;s first quantitative Star Wars data set that can be used for programming. The developers have aggregated multiple types of entity data involved in the Star Wars series of movies. It also provides a Python programming language package, swapi-python, which is built by the author of swapi, Paul Hallett.
The six APIs correspond to six types of entities:
 Films：http://swapi.co/api/films/1 People：http://swapi.co/api/people/1 Starships：http://swapi.co/api/starships/1 Vehicles：http://swapi.co/api/vehicles/1 Species：http://swapi.</description>

      <description>During my internship at Birch.ai, we want to test and improve the performance of our machine translation model. To achieve this, we first need to obtain a foreign language data set and its corresponding English data set, and hope that these data sets are translated by humans rather than machine translations.
In this article, I would share my experience in scraping The New England Journal of Medicine from scratch using Python.</description>

      <description>How to convert Python data frame to Sqlite3 database? It is quite easy in the Jupyter Notebook with sql extension. With this powerful extension, we can excecute SQL query in Jupyter Notebook, which is quite convenient.
In this article, I would share my experience in creating a Sqlite3 database to store Spotify songs data in the 3rd Normal Form using Python. It is quite easy, everyone who has some basic Python skills can follow my steps and try to do it.</description>

      <title>How terrible is malaria? (Data visualization with Python)</title>

      <description>Malaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria are typically very sick with high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. Because malaria causes so much illness and death, the disease is a great drain on many national economies. Since many countries with malaria are already among the poorer nations, the disease maintains a vicious cycle of disease and poverty.</description>

      <title>3 problems on Euler Project</title>

      <description>In this article, I would share my solutions to 3 problems of Project Euler using Python. The problems on Project Euler are designed according to the &amp;quot;one-minute rule&amp;quot;, which shows that an efficient implementation will allow a solution to be obtained in less then one minute. This is a good website where you can practice designing efficient algorithms for many difficult problems. I will continue to resolve problems on this website and update this blog in the future.</description>

      <description>In this article, I would share my experiences and the steps I took when building a personal website on GitHub Pages using Hugo. To build a personal website, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have knowledge other than writing Markdown. It&amp;rsquo;s simple, let&amp;rsquo;s go!
You can find my Github repository for this blog here.
Step 1: Install Git Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</description>

      <description>Nice to meet you, and welcome to Linlin Li&amp;rsquo;s website! I am Linlin Li, a student in the Master’s of Statistical Science program at Duke University.
I have always been eager to create a personal website to write interesting things and record my own growth. Fortunately, one of my courses requires me to update on my website, and I took this opportunity to make this idea come true. In the beginning, I planned to focus on documenting data science projects for future reference and let the website record the track of my learning.</description>
