      <description>Nice to meet you, and welcome to Linlin Li&amp;rsquo;s website! I am Linlin Li, a student in the Master’s of Statistical Science program at Duke University.
I have always been eager to create a personal website to write interesting things and record my own growth. Fortunately, one of my courses requires me to update on my website, and I took this opportunity to make this idea come true. In the beginning, I planned to focus on documenting data science projects for future reference and let the website record the track of my learning.</description>
